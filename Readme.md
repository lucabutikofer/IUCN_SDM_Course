# Transdisciplinary Nature Conservation: the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species from evaluation to practice

During the morning we go through the theory and the steps necessary to model the distribution of a species. You will be able to try out most of the topics discussed immediately using [Wallace](https://wallaceecomod.github.io)â€”a modular platform that does not require coding skills.

To get things started, first thing in the morning, open R or RStudio and execute the following lines of code (copy-paste them in the console and press ENTER):

```
install.packages("wallace")
library(wallace)
run_wallace()
```

This will get Wallace to boot in a browser window. Your computer should now be ready.
